## Why this fork

[Explorer Tab Utility](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility) by [@w4po](https://github.com/w4po) is an excellent tool, but the original repository has had no activity since May 2025 (last release v2.5.0). In the meantime the community kept sending fixes for real bugs — windows that could no longer be opened, crashes on shutdown, lost file selection — and new features such as a multi-language UI and bookmarks. Those pull requests were never merged.

ExplorerTabPlus collects them into one build, keeps it compiling on CI, and publishes releases. It is a **drop-in upgrade**: the executable, settings folder, startup entry and installer ID are unchanged, so installing it over the original keeps your settings and hotkey profiles.

## What's new compared with upstream v2.5.0

Every change below is an open pull request from the upstream repository, merged here with the original author's commits intact.

| PR | Change | Author |
|---|---|---|
| [#139](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/139) | Fix `ObjectDisposedException` on shutdown (double dispose of shell objects) | [@taroyamadax](https://github.com/taroyamadax) |
| [#137](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/137) | Fix Explorer windows becoming unopenable: stale COM cleanup, recovery after sleep/hibernate, keep the window visible if tab conversion fails | [@youncyb](https://github.com/youncyb) |
| [#142](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/142) | Clean up tab navigation event handlers and avoid synchronous COM callback re-entry (related to the stuck loading cursor) | [@yueyangcode](https://github.com/yueyangcode) |
| [#144](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/144) | Preserve the requested file selection ("Show in folder", `explorer /select`) when converting or reusing tabs | [@aiolosking](https://github.com/aiolosking) |
| [#131](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/131) | Multi-language UI (English, Simplified Chinese) | [@NeedJustWord](https://github.com/NeedJustWord) |
| [#140](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/pull/140) | Bookmark management: save, navigate, organize, import/export bookmarks, open them in the current tab, a new tab or a new window | [@NeedJustWord](https://github.com/NeedJustWord) |

Fork maintenance: the in-app updater checks this repository's releases, CI builds every change for both target frameworks, and releases are built without the upstream signing service.

## Features

<details>
<summary><b>Automatic window-to-tab conversion</b></summary>

- New Explorer windows open as tabs in an existing window

<summary><b>Tab search / switcher</b></summary>

- Type part of a folder name or path to find and switch to any open tab

## Installation

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/doomsday616/ExplorerTabPlus/releases/latest).

**Installer (recommended):** `ExplorerTabUtility_<version>_Setup.exe` picks the right build for your CPU. If the .NET 9 Desktop Runtime is missing it offers to install it, or falls back to the .NET Framework 4.8.1 build.

**Portable zip:** pick one file by runtime and CPU architecture.

| Runtime | File suffix | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| .NET 9 | `_Net9.0_FrameworkDependent.zip` | [.NET 9 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) |
| .NET Framework 4.8.1 | `_NetFW4.8.1.zip` | Nothing — included with Windows 11 |

| Architecture | Use when |
|---|---|
| `x64` | Most Intel/AMD PCs |
| `arm64` | Windows on ARM (Snapdragon, etc.) |
| `x86` | 32-bit Windows only |

Unzip anywhere and run `ExplorerTabUtility.exe`. Look for the tray icon.

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading from the original Explorer Tab Utility:** just run the installer (or replace the files). The app keeps the same executable name, the same settings at `%APPDATA%\ExplorerTabUtility\`, and the same installer ID, so it upgrades in place and keeps your settings. Future updates are offered from this repository.

> [!WARNING]
> **Builds are not code-signed.** Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" — choose *More info* → *Run anyway*. Like the original, some antivirus products may flag the keyboard/mouse hooks and COM automation as suspicious; this is a false positive, and you can always [build from source](#build-from-source).

## Usage

The app runs in the system tray. Double-click or right-click the tray icon to open settings.

![Tray menu](Assets/Menu.png)

**General settings**

- **Window Hook** — automatic window-to-tab conversion
- **Reuse Tabs** — switch to an existing tab instead of opening a duplicate
- **Keyboard Hook / Mouse Hook** — hotkeys and mouse navigation
- **Startup** — start with Windows
- Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\ExplorerTabUtility\settings.json`; delete it to reset

**Preferences:** auto update, alternative window hiding for custom themes ("I have theme issues"), save closed history, restore previous windows, hide tray icon (requires a `ToggleVisibility` hotkey first).

![Preferences](Assets/Preferences.png)

**Hotkey profiles.** Each profile has a hotkey, a scope (Global or Explorer-only), an action, an optional path, a delay and a "Handled" toggle that decides whether the keystroke is passed on to other apps. Profiles can be imported and exported.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Open` | Open a location (empty path = new tab) |
| `Duplicate` | Duplicate the current tab |
| `ReopenClosed` | Reopen the last closed location |
| `TabSearch` | Open the tab search popup |
| `NavigateBack` / `NavigateForward` / `NavigateUp` | Navigate in the current tab |
| `SetTargetWindow` | Mark the current window as the target for new tabs |
| `ToggleWinHook` / `ToggleReuseTabs` / `ToggleVisibility` | Toggle features / main window |
| `DetachTab` | Move the current tab into a new window |
| `SnapRight` / `SnapLeft` / `SnapUp` / `SnapDown` | Snap the current window |
| `BookmarkSave` / `BookmarkNavigate` / `BookmarkManage` | Save, open and manage bookmarks (new) |

Default profiles: <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> opens Home, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> duplicates the tab, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> reopens the last closed tab.

## Build from source

Requirements: Windows, Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the .NET desktop workload, and the .NET 9 SDK. The project uses COM references (`Shell32`, `SHDocVw`), so it must be built with full-framework **MSBuild**; `dotnet build` alone fails with `MSB4803`.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/doomsday616/ExplorerTabPlus.git
cd ExplorerTabPlus
msbuild ExplorerTabUtility/ExplorerTabUtility.csproj /restore /p:Configuration=Release /p:TargetFramework=net9.0-windows
# or /p:TargetFramework=net481
```

Navigation regression checks (from PR #142): `dotnet run --project tests/NavigationCompletion.Tests.csproj -c Release`.
